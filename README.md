# NBAViz

## Note: The app currently includes node_modules because installing node_modules from a docker container takes long.

## Currently Working On:

- Making the front end pretty.
- Deploying the app.

## How To Setup:
- Step 1: Setup the docker image and run the container
  -  run `docker compose build` and then `docker compose up` OR only run `docker compose up -d` (this does both steps in one command)
- Step 2: Goto localhost:5173
