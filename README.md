# NBAViz


## Currently Working On:

- Making the front end pretty.
- Reducing page load time for data that has not been cached.
- Deploying the app.
- Adding a search functionality

## How To Setup:
- Step 1: Setup the docker image and run the container
  -  run `docker compose build` and then `docker compose up` OR only run `docker compose up -d` (this does both steps in one command)  
- Step 2: Run the frontend
  - Navigate to the frontend/nbaviz directory and run `npm install` and then `npm start`
